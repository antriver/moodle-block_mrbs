# Moodle Room and Vehicle Booking System
A fork of the original MRBS plugin for Moodle, this also allows users to book vehicles and specify the destination and number of passengers.

## Setup
* Give users the block/mrbs:bookvehicles capability.
* Create an area with the name *Vehicles* and add vehicles in this area.
